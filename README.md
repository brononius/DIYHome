# DIYHome

I just bought my daughter (10y) a ‘DIY home kit from Keyestudio 5’ to keep her occupied during summer holiday. She already had a lot of fun with building it, and thinking what she can do with it. My target was to let her play a bit with HA. But sadly, this was not so straight forward. I guess I maybe wiped somewhere the ESP board with my first HA connectivity. But I learned a lot around ESP32 with this kit, so it was positive at the end.

To be honest, I’m very surpised! For this price, you get a real nice package of different sensors (temperature, moisture, humidity, PIR, NFC, gas, buzzer, fan, servo, led, RGB led, display…).
